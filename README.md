# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A single page web application that helps visualize the sorting of data within an array using popular sorting algorithms.

## Algorithms Supported:
 - Selection Sort (Finds the smallest number in the iteration and swaps it to the front)
 - Bubble Sort (Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if out of order)
 - Insertion Sort (Compares each element to previous ones, leading to swaps and array shifts)
 - Merge Sort (Divides into equal sub arrays, does it's comparison then finally merges them all back together -> Divide and Conquer)
 - Quick Sort (Recursively compare sub arrays to a given pivot and dynamically shift array -> Divide and Conquer)

## Technologies
This app was created using:
- HTML5 / CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery 3.8.0
